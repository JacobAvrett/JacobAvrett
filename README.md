Howdy! I'm pretty new to programming in general, I've been studying and doing small projects for a couple months total, but only about a month 
with Javascript. I'm hoping to collaborate, or find some veteran programmers that would like to extend their knowledge my way. I'm open to 
criticisms, and sharing knowledge. I look forward to talking with you, and hope you're having a great day, thank you!
